The Athenians accordingly increased in power; and\nmod000149.xml|130|pped as follows: on their heads they wore loose coverings, called tiaras; on the body, various-colored sleeved breastplates, with iron scales like those of fish; and on their legs, loose trowsers; and, instead of shields, bucklers made of osiers; and under them th\nmod000149.xml|130|scribed, and they had shields, and spears, and daggers similar to those of the Egyptians, and, besides, wooden clubs knotted with iron, and linen cuirasses.

The Indians, clad with garments made of cotton, had bows of cane, and arrows of cane tipped with iron.

The first are to be Guardians, the second Auxiliaries, the third husbandmen and craftsmen ; and thi\nmod000153.xml|130|here were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice.

Ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and iron age succeeding one another, but Plato supposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a single state. Mytho\nmod000153.xml|130|he State will decline, and education fall into decay; gymnastic will be preferred to music, and the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass\u2014thus division will arise.

But the colour varies al\nmod000363.xml|130| the receiver, where the phenomenon presents all the appearance of combustion, and, secondly, in the real combustion in air. With iron the experiment is equally instructive. Iron is volatilized by the Voltaic arc in nitrogen, or in an exhausted 305 receiver; and w\nmod000363.xml|130|washed with an acid, it then gives, with ferrocyanide of potassium, the Prussian-blue precipitate.

In sho\nmod000363.xml|130| not only precisely the same with the action of two magnets on one another, but its influence in producing temporary magnetism in iron and steel is also the same with magnetic induction. The term induction, when applied to electric currents, expresses the power 31\nmod000363.xml|130| in their immediate neighbourhood, otherwise neutral or indifferent. For example, the connecting wire of a galvanic battery holds iron filings suspended like a magnet as long as the current continues to flow through it: the iron becomes magnetic by the induction o\nmod000363.xml|130|ng wire of a galvanic battery holds iron filings suspended like a magnet as long as the current continues to flow through it: the iron becomes magnetic by the induction of the current. The most powerful temporary magnets are obtained by bending a thick cylinder of\nmod000363.xml|130|es magnetic by the induction of the current. The most powerful temporary magnets are obtained by bending a thick cylinder of soft iron into the form of a horseshoe, and surrounding it with a coil of thick copper wire covered with silk to prevent communication betw\nmod000363.xml|130|ick copper wire covered with silk to prevent communication between its coils. When this wire forms part of a galvanic circuit the iron becomes so highly magnetic by the induction of the current flowing through the wire that a temporary magnet of this kind made by \nmod000363.xml|130| a pistol. But the most powerful known is that employed by Mr. Joule in his experiments, which sustains a weight of 2080 lbs. The iron loses its magnetism the instant the electricity ceases to flow, and acquires it again as instantaneously when the circuit is rene\nmod000363.xml|130|p\u00e8re\u2019s explanation of the ultimate nature of magnetism. However, in Amp\u00e8re\u2019s theory, the current of electricity flowing round the iron makes it a permanent magnet, but it does not make the heavy glass or the other bodies, which have the same property, either tempo\nmod000363.xml|130| molecular condition of the substances, when the light is rotating in them, must be specifically distinct from that of magnetised iron: it must therefore be a new magnetic condition, and the force which the matter in this state possesses must be a new magnetic for\nmod000363.xml|130|has named magneto-electricity. A great quantity of copper wire was coiled in the form of a helix round one half of a ring of soft iron, and connected with a galvanic battery; while a similar helix connected with a galvanometer was wound round the other half of the\nmod000363.xml|130|. Similar effects were produced by an apparatus consisting of two helices of copper wire coiled round a block of wood, instead of iron, from which Dr. Faraday infers that the electric current passing from the battery through one wire induces a similar current thro\nmod000363.xml|130|entical in their effects in this experiment. Again, when a helix formed of 220 feet of copper wire, into which a cylinder of soft iron was introduced, was placed between the north and south poles of two bar magnets, and connected with the galvanometer by means of \nmod000363.xml|130|connected with the galvanometer by means of wires from each extremity, as often as the magnets were brought into contact with the iron cylinder it became magnetic by induction, and produced a deflection in the needle of the galvanometer. On continuing the contact \nmod000363.xml|130|elve steel plates in close approximation, is placed in a horizontal position. An armature, consisting of a bar of the purest soft iron, has each of its ends bent at right angles, so that the faces of those ends may be brought directly opposite and close to the pol\nmod000363.xml|130|e magnet when required. Ten copper wires\u2014covered with silk, in order to insulate them\u2014are wound round one half of the bar of soft iron, as a compound helix: ten other wires, also insulated, are wound round the other half of the bar. The extremities of the first se\nmod000363.xml|130| square, the exciting fluid being dilute sulphuric acid. Although the force developed by this battery is so great that a piece of iron three inches long and three eighths of an inch in diameter placed in contact with the poles may be consumed in a few minutes, it \nmod000363.xml|130|f sufficient strength. To accomplish that, many thousand yards of fine copper wire coated with silk are wound round a hollow soft iron cylinder; the whole is then coated by gutta percha, and the end of the wire is joined to the wires in the cable so as to form a c\nmod000363.xml|130| the battery, currents of electricity flow through it, between pole and pole, and in their passage temporarily convert the hollow iron cylinder into a powerful electro-magnet, which by its reaction induces a current of electricity in the fine wire of sufficient po\nmod000363.xml|130|y an extraneous force, the other will tend to revolve about it in the same direction, and with the same velocity. When a plate of iron, or of any substance capable of being made either a temporary or permanent magnet, revolves between the poles of a magnet, it is \nmod000363.xml|130|an one, then the power is not electric. These investigations show that there are really very few bodies magnetic in the manner of iron. Dr. Faraday therefore arranges substances in three classes, with regard to their relation to magnets:\u2014those affected by the magn\nmod000363.xml|130|e arranges substances in three classes, with regard to their relation to magnets:\u2014those affected by the magnet when at rest, like iron, steel, and nickel, which possess ordinary magnetic properties; those affected when in motion, in which electric currents are evo\nmod000363.xml|130|eck, the same substance, unequally heated, exhibits electrical currents; and M. Nobili observed, that in all metals, except zinc, iron, and antimony, the electricity flows from the hot part towards that which is cold. That philosopher attributes terrestrial magnet\nmod000363.xml|130|r a\u00ebriform, are more or less magnetic, but that the magnetism is very different in different substances. For example, if a bar of iron be freely suspended between the poles of a very powerful magnet or electro-magnet, it will be attracted by both poles, and will s\nmod000363.xml|130|if a similar bar of bismuth be freely suspended in the same manner, it will rest in a direction at right angles to that which the iron bar assumed. Thus the direction in which the iron sets is axial or in the line of force, while that which the bismuth assumes is \nmod000363.xml|130| the same manner, it will rest in a direction at right angles to that which the iron bar assumed. Thus the direction in which the iron sets is axial or in the line of force, while that which the bismuth assumes is equatorial or perpendicular to the line of force. \nmod000363.xml|130|t which the bismuth assumes is equatorial or perpendicular to the line of force. Substances that are magnetic after the manner of iron are said to be paramagnetic, those that are magnetic after the manner of bismuth are diamagnetic. As far as we know, all matter c\nmod000363.xml|130|h are diamagnetic. As far as we know, all matter comes under one or 336 other of these laws. Many bodies are paramagnetic besides iron, as the loadstone, which consists of the peroxide and protoxide of iron mixed with small portions of silica and alumina; also som\nmod000363.xml|130|other of these laws. Many bodies are paramagnetic besides iron, as the loadstone, which consists of the peroxide and protoxide of iron mixed with small portions of silica and alumina; also some of the gems and metals, as cobalt, nickel, and c. A substance is often\nmod000363.xml|130| and metals, as cobalt, nickel, and c. A substance is often paramagnetic if it contains only the 130,000 th part of its weight of iron; but by far the greater number are diamagnetic, as all animal and vegetable matter, acids, oils, sugar, starch, bread, and c., an\nmod000363.xml|130|r south even when floating on water, because the same pole that attracts one end repels the other. Both poles of a magnet attract iron, which in return attracts either pole of the magnet with an equal and contrary force. The action of a magnet on unmagnetised iron\nmod000363.xml|130|iron, which in return attracts either pole of the magnet with an equal and contrary force. The action of a magnet on unmagnetised iron is confined to attraction, whereas the reciprocal agency of magnets is characterised by a repulsive as well as by an attractive f\nmod000363.xml|130|ramagnetism in such bodies in its vicinity as are capable of receiving it. By this property the mere approach of a magnet renders iron and steel paramagnetic, 337 the more powerfully the less the distance, but the induced force is always exactly equal to the force\nmod000363.xml|130|ly equal to the force which produces it. When the north end of a magnet is brought near to, and in the line with, an unmagnetised iron bar, the bar acquires all the properties of a perfect magnet; the end next the north pole of the magnet becomes a south pole, whi\nmod000363.xml|130|ut as the action is greater on the adjacent than on the distant part, the resulting force is that of attraction. By induction the iron bar not only acquires polarity, but the power of inducing paramagnetism in a third body; and although all these properties vanish\nmod000363.xml|130|nly acquires polarity, but the power of inducing paramagnetism in a third body; and although all these properties vanish from the iron as soon as the magnet is removed, a lasting increase of intensity is generally imparted to the magnet itself by the reaction of t\nmod000363.xml|130| a lasting increase of intensity is generally imparted to the magnet itself by the reaction of the temporary paramagnetism of the iron. Iron acquires the inductive force more rapidly than steel, yet it loses it as quickly on the removal of the magnet, whereas the \nmod000363.xml|130|s from its mechanical operation exciting a vibration among the particles of the steel. It has been observed that the particles of iron easily resume their neutral state after induction, while those of steel resist the restoration of equilibrium, or a return to the\nmod000363.xml|130| a table, spreading a sheet of stiff paper over it so as to be perfectly level and free from creases, and then sifting very clean iron filings through a fine sieve equably over it. The filings will instantly assume the form of the curved lines represented by fig. \nmod000363.xml|130|o friction, which arrests the magnetic forces, so as first to oppose their separation, and then to prevent their reunion. In soft iron the coercive force is either wanting or extremely feeble, since iron is easily rendered paramagnetic by induction, and as easily \nmod000363.xml|130|their separation, and then to prevent their reunion. In soft iron the coercive force is either wanting or extremely feeble, since iron is easily rendered paramagnetic by induction, and as easily loses that quality; whereas in steel the coercive force is extremely \nmod000363.xml|130|amagnetic properties rapidly, and entirely hinders it from losing them when acquired. The feebleness of 341 the coercive force in iron, and its energy in steel, with regard to the paramagnetic force, is perfectly analogous to the facility of transmission afforded \nmod000363.xml|130|immediately disturbed on the approach of the pole of a magnet, which by induction transfers one kind of polarity to one end of an iron or steel bar, and the opposite kind to the other\u2014effects exactly similar to electrical induction. There is even a correspondence \nmod000363.xml|130|uence of the electric current induced by these lines of magnetic force in the wire, and the action is greater when a core of soft iron is placed in the helix, which becomes a temporary magnet by induction. Again, if a copper plate be connected with a galvanometer \nmod000363.xml|130|sm. If we calculate, in fact, what is the magnetic force of this fluid mass, we find that it is equivalent to an immense plate of iron, of a thickness little more than 1\u2044250 of an inch, which covers the whole surface of the globe.\u201d Both the conducting power of the\nmod000363.xml|130|es of magnetic action. He also discovered that magnetic bodies differ exceedingly in their magnetic power: of paramagnetic bodies iron is the most powerful; then follow nickel, cobalt, and a long gradation down to osmium and a vacuum. The body that seems to have t\nmod000363.xml|130|ems to have the lowest diamagnetic power is arsenic, and the series ascends to heavy glass, antimony, phosphorus, and bismuth; so iron and bismuth are the most powerful in their respective classes, and both have a small conducting power for electricity. It may be \nmod000363.xml|130| but that such may be compounded by mixing in due proportion a diamagnetic and paramagnetic liquid, as water and protosulphate of iron.> Professor Tyndall proved diamagnetic polarity by placing two bismuth bars within two vertical coils or spirals of insulated cop\nmod000363.xml|130|s of science. It follows from this that, when a man is standing, his head is a north pole and his feet a south, and the top of an iron railing on which he may be leaning is a south pole and the lower end a north. Diamagnetic bodies thus possess a polarity, the sam\nmod000363.xml|130| of curved and closed lines of force passing through the interior of the substance. Dr. Tyndall has proved that the attraction of iron, and the repulsion of bismuth, are as the square of the electro-magnetic current producing them, and that diamagnetic substances \nmod000363.xml|130| in the direction of its principal optic axis, and least strongly in the direction of its least axis. In a sphere of carbonate of iron, which has exactly the same crystalline form and is highly paramagnetic, the line which in carbonate of lime sets equatorially, i\nmod000363.xml|130|ets axially, and more strongly in that direction than in any other. The law according to which the attraction of the carbonate of iron increases from the least to its greatest or principal optic axis, is precisely the same as that according to which the repulsion \nmod000363.xml|130|made only with diamagnetic or slightly paramagnetic bodies, which induced M. le Roux to try the effect of magnetism on pulverized iron compressed by the hydraulic press, which reduced the grains of iron to lamell\u00e6 equivalent to planes of cleavage. Cubes of this su\nmod000363.xml|130|duced M. le Roux to try the effect of magnetism on pulverized iron compressed by the hydraulic press, which reduced the grains of iron to lamell\u00e6 equivalent to planes of cleavage. Cubes of this substance, suspended by a thread over a horseshoe magnet, oscillated f\nmod000363.xml|130| the vertical position of the cleavages, which increases the diamagnetism of the bismuth, increases also the paramagnetism of the iron. M. le Roux observes that these results are independent of the influence of the currents of electricity induced in the oscillatin\nmod000363.xml|130|tely connected with paramagnetism or diamagnetism itself, since the effect of that arrangement is equally sensible in bismuth and iron, although the diamagnetism of the former is 25,000 times weaker than the paramagnetism of the latter.> The diamagnetism of conduc\nmod000363.xml|130| silver, and copper, is augmented by division. Compression has also a great effect on magnetic action. For example, a bar of soft iron sets with its longest dimensions from pole to pole of a magnet, but a bar of compressed carbonate of iron-dust, whose shortest di\nmod000363.xml|130| example, a bar of soft iron sets with its longest dimensions from pole to pole of a magnet, but a bar of compressed carbonate of iron-dust, whose shortest dimensions coincide with the line of pressure, sets equatorially. A bar of bismuth whose plane of principal \nmod000363.xml|130|and the bar sets axially. Again, since the paramagnetic force augments with the conducting power, the action of the magnet on the iron is antithetic to that on the bismuth.> The action of an electro-magnet on copper is strongly contrasted with that which it exerts\nmod000363.xml|130| antithetic to that on the bismuth. The action of an electro-magnet on copper is strongly contrasted with that which it exerts on iron or bismuth. For when a copper bar suspended by a thread revolves before its pole, it is brought to a dead halt as soon as the ele\nmod000363.xml|130|rties of bodies. Dr. Faraday found that, when the temperature of nickel is increased, its magnetic force diminishes; when that of iron is increased its magnetic force remains the same, while that of cobalt increases; which seems to indicate that there is a tempera\nmod000363.xml|130|e magnetic force is a maximum, above and below which it diminishes. Nickel loses its magnetism at the temperature of boiling oil, iron at a red heat, and cobalt near the temperature at which copper melts. Calcareous spar retains its magnetic character at a very hi\nmod000363.xml|130| copper melts. Calcareous spar retains its magnetic character at a very high temperature; but the same substance when it contains iron, and also oxide of iron, loses it entirely at a dull red heat.

Matteucci has found that the mechanical compression of glass alters the rotatory power of a\nmod000363.xml|130|, is led to believe that the ethereal medium too is magnetic by the following experiment.

Here there was a diamagnetic phenomenon, although the glass globules and the liquid in which they were immersed contained iron. The effect was evidently differential, for when the liquid was less attracted than the globule, the globule approached the pole,\nmod000363.xml|130|magnetic phenomena the result of a differential action of this kind, and is the ethereal medium less strongly attracted than soft iron, and more strongly attracted than bismuth, thus permitting the approach of the iron, but causing the bismuth to recede from the p\nmod000363.xml|130|real medium less strongly attracted than soft iron, and more strongly attracted than bismuth, thus permitting the approach of the iron, but causing the bismuth to recede from the pole of a magnet? If such a medium exist, that is, if the ethereal medium be magnetic\nmod000363.xml|130| the ethereal medium be magnetic, then diamagnetism is 357 the same with paramagnetism, and the polarity of the magnetic force in iron and bismuth is one and the same.> The ethereal medium may be presumed to transmit the gravitating force; it transmits the magneti\nmod000365.xml|130|l victory of the socialist proletariat a leap of humanity from the animal world into the realm of freedom.
