In Pergamon in 133 BCE, after Attal\nmod000132.xml|130|hile ecclesiastical courts continued using Latin.

T\nmod000132.xml|130| practice revealed here coincides with a separation of property, which was common amongst the Strasbourg nobility. [79] These 200 silver marks (400 Strasbourg pounds) included the following goods and property (within and out of town) : an income of fifty-three quart\nmod000132.xml|130| contract. A year later, Dina married a patrician from Strasbourg, Johannes zur Megede. [83] The total value of the dowry was 250 silver marks (150 from the husband, 100 from his wife). The property brought by Dina came from her share of the inheritance and from the\nmod000132.xml|130|istrates\u2019 court. Bertha was the daughter of the late Heinzmann Wetzel.

This is known because the Delphians fill it at the t\nmod000147.xml|130| of Theodore the Samian, and I think that they say true, for assuredly it is the work of no common artist. Croesus sent also four silver casks, which are in the Corinthian treasury, and two lustral vases, a golden and a silver one. On the former is inscribed the nam\nmod000147.xml|130|o common artist.

But yet, in accordance with what I have said before of his great moderation, he restored the rest of the silver after he had torn off the figures; so free was he from all avarice!

As early as 1772 M. Scheele showed that the pure white colour of chloride of silver was rapidly darkened by the blue rays of the solar spectrum, while the red rays had no effect upon it: and in 1801 M.

Since the effect of the chemical agency of light is to destroy the affinity between the salt and the silver, Mr. Talbot found that, in order to render these impressions permanent on paper, it was only necessary to wash it with salt and w\nmod000363.xml|130|een advantageously substituted, which are the most efficacious in dissolving and removing the unchanged salt, leaving the reduced silver on the paper.

Sir John met with another instance on paper prepared with bromide of silver, on which the whole of the space occupied by the visible spectrum was darkened down to the very extremity of the red rays, but an\nmod000363.xml|130|ng blackened by exposure to common daylight, or to the most refrangible rays of the solar spectrum.

By means of this apparatus the electrical discharge could be sent through any kind of \nmod000363.xml|130|media.

One of these is the adulteration of the coin. A pound sterling, or twenty shillings, originally weighed a pound of silver; hence its denomination. But sovereigns, in making new coinages, frequently found it convenient to adulterate the metal by mixing\nmod000367.xml|130|mpts to conquer France, adopted this mode of paying his creditors with less money than he borrowed of them. He ordered a pound of silver to be coined into 266, instead of 240 pennies. Having experienced the beneficial effects of this expedient, he soon after coined \nmod000367.xml|130|accumulated  debts, continued to depreciate the value of the coin; endeavouring to conceal the fraud by the introduction of a new silver coin called a groat, but in value only 3\u00bcd.: and in 1358 he made 75 groats, or 300 pennies, out of a pound of silver.> Caroline: \nmod000367.xml|130|ion of a new silver coin called a groat, but in value only 3\u00bcd.: and in 1358 he made 75 groats, or 300 pennies, out of a pound of silver.> Caroline: What a prodigious depreciation in the course of so short a period of time! and have similar expedients been resorted \nmod000367.xml|130|ive sovereigns?

It is this which caused our specie to disappear, and transported it to foreign countries, where it w\nmod000367.xml|130|such countries as, having mines of their own, may be said to produce money.

We have, in a former conversa\nmod000367.xml|130|t as a commodity for which there is a demand. This demand will always take place in thriving countries, not only because gold and silver bullion are wanted by jewellers and silversmiths for the purposes of luxury: but also because, as the saleable produce of the cou\nmod000367.xml|130|starving, or became members of that very army which caused their ruin.
