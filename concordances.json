So that \u2018nothing has become dearer\u2019: since the golden \u00e9cu was worth twenty sols tournois in accounting money under Philippe VI, \nmod000006.xml|130|e worth ten. \u2018The increasing dearness of things does not come from having to deliver more but from receiving a lesser quantity of gold or \ufb01ne silver than one was accustomed to before.\u2019 But once this identi\ufb01cation has been established between the role of money and \nmod000006.xml|130|n prices therefore has a \u2018principal cause, and that almost the only one that no one has touched upon hitherto\u2019: \u2018the abundance of gold and silver\u2019, \u2018the abundance of that which gives things estimation and price\u2019. The standard of equivalences is itself involved in \nmod000006.xml|130|of all commodities in a certain and de\ufb01nitive fashion. This relation is the one that was established by Providence when it buried gold and silver mines under the earth, and caused them to grow, just as plants grow and animals multiply on the surface of the earth. \nmod000006.xml|130|ti says: Nature made all terrestrial things good; the sum of these, by virtue of the agreement concluded by men, is worth all the gold that is worked; all men therefore desire everything in order to acquire all things . . . In order to ascertain each day the rule \nmod000006.xml|130| things . . . In order to ascertain each day the rule and mathematical proportions that exist between things and between them and gold, we should have to be able to contemplate, from the height of heaven or some very tall observatory, all the things that exist or \nmod000006.xml|130|cted in the sky as in a faithful mirror. We would then abandon all our calculations and we would say: there is upon earth so much gold, so many things, so many men, so many needs; and to the degree that each thing satis\ufb01es needs, its value shall be so many things,\nmod000006.xml|130|ings, so many men, so many needs; and to the degree that each thing satis\ufb01es needs, its value shall be so many things, or so much gold.9 This celestial and exhaustive calculation can be accomplished by none other than God: it corresponds to that other calculation \nmod000006.xml|130| them, if they dig mines and make war on one another in order to get hold of them, it is because the process of minting them into gold and silver coinage has given them a utility and a rarity that those metals do not possess of themselves. \u2018Money does not draw its\nmod000006.xml|130| it, just as our ideas are what they are because we represent them. Monetary or verbal signs are additional to this. But why have gold and silver, which are scarcely wealth at all in themselves, received or taken on this signifying power? No doubt one could very w\nmod000006.xml|130|ies is still a cheap commodity, becomes precious in others only when it is turned into coinage.16 But in a general fashion we use gold and silver because they contain hidden within themselves \u2018a peculiar perfection\u2019. A perfection that is not of the order of price,\nmod000006.xml|130| concentrate a great weight into a little volume; they can be easily transported; they are easily pierced. All these factors make gold and silver into a privileged instrument for the representation of all other kinds of wealth, and for strict comparisons between t\nmod000006.xml|130|ermit it to establish relations of equality and di\ufb00erence between di\ufb00erent kinds of wealth. It is apparent, then, that the use of gold and silver for this purpose has a justi\ufb01able basis. As Bouteroue says, money \u2018is a portion of matter to which public authority ha\nmod000006.xml|130|ermits wealth to be represented. Without such signs, wealth would remain immobile, useless, and as it were silent; in this sense, gold and silver are the creators of all that man can covet. But in order to play this role as representation, money must o\ufb00er properti\nmod000006.xml|130| it; and the principle established by Bodin that the great dearness prevalent in the sixteenth century was caused by the in\ufb02ux of gold from America is not valid; though it is true that an increase in specie causes prices to rise at \ufb01rst, it also stimulates trade a\nmod000006.xml|130| and a favourable balance, one can attract fresh merchandise and increase both agriculture and manufacturing. As Horneck puts it, gold and silver \u2018are the purest part of our blood, the marrow of our strength\u2019, \u2018the most indispensable instruments of human activity \nmod000006.xml|130|t is that which de\ufb01nes money as a pledge. It is a de\ufb01nition we \ufb01nd in Locke and, slightly earlier, in Vaughan;37 then in Melon \u2013 \u2018gold and silver are, by general agreement, the pledge, the equivalent, or the common measure of all that which serves for men\u2019s use\u2019;3\nmod000006.xml|130|ommon measure of all that which serves for men\u2019s use\u2019;38 in Dutot \u2013 \u2018wealth of credit or opinion is only repre- sentative, as are gold, silver, bronze, and copper\u2019;39 in Fortbonnais \u2013 \u2018the important point\u2019 in conventional wealth lies \u2018in the con\ufb01dence of the owner\nmod000006.xml|130|one is to the total of the other, so part of the one is to part of the other . . .

The Englishman, so long as h\nmod000058.xml|130|ily,\" sighs the French nation. The Englishman, so long as he was in his right mind, could not get rid of the fixed idea of making gold. The French, so long as they were engaged in revolution, could not get rid of the memory of Napoleon, as the election of December\nmod000058.xml|130|on of bourgeois society, and finally the new stage of development which this society seemed to have entered with the discovery of gold in California and Australia, induced me to start again from the very beginning and to work carefully through the new material. Th\nmod000058.xml|130|consider the matter more closely. A given commodity, a quarter of wheat for example, is exchanged for x boot-polish, y silk, or z gold, etc. In short, it is exchanged for other commodities in the most diverse proportions. Therefore the wheat has many exchange valu\nmod000058.xml|130|ties in the most diverse proportions. Therefore the wheat has many exchange values instead of one. But x boot-polish, y silk or z gold, etc., each represent the exchange-value of one quarter of wheat. Therefore x boot-polish, y silk, z gold, etc., must, as exchang\nmod000058.xml|130|oot-polish, y silk or z gold, etc., each represent the exchange-value of one quarter of wheat. Therefore x boot-polish, y silk, z gold, etc., must, as exchange-values, be mutually replaceable or of identical magnitude. It follows from this that, firstly, the valid\nmod000058.xml|130|s, on an average, a great deal of labour-time. Consequently much labour is represented in a small volume. Jacob questions whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value. This applies still more to diamonds. According to Eschwege, the total produce of the Br\nmod000058.xml|130|tomary stability, they appear to result from the nature of the products, so that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear to be equal in value, in the same way as a pound of gold and a pound of iron are equal in weight, despite their different \nmod000058.xml|130|roducts, so that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear to be equal in value, in the same way as a pound of gold and a pound of iron are equal in weight, despite their different physical and chemical properties. The value character of the pro\nmod000058.xml|130| is self-evident. Nevertheless, when the producers of coats and boots bring these commodities into a relation with linen, or with gold or silver (and this makes no difference here), as the universal equivalent, the relation between their own private labour and the\nmod000058.xml|130|f simplicity vanishes. Where did the illusions of the Monetary System come from? The adherents of the Monetary System did not see gold and silver as representing money as a social relation of production, but in the > form of natural objects with peculiar social pr\nmod000058.xml|130|e social function of a universal equivalent. Those commodities are the precious metals. The truth of the statement that 'although gold and silver are not by nature money, money is by nature gold and silver,'35 is shown by the appropriateness of their natural prope\nmod000058.xml|130|es are the precious metals. The truth of the statement that 'although gold and silver are not by nature money, money is by nature gold and silver,'35 is shown by the appropriateness of their natural properties for the functions of money.36 So far, however, we are \nmod000058.xml|130|ossess these properties by nature. The money commodity acquires a dual use-value. Alongside its special use-value as a commodity (gold, for instance, serves to fill hollow teeth, it forms the raw material for luxury articles, etc.) it acquires a formal usevalue, a\nmod000058.xml|130|ue but its specific value-form. Confusion between these two attributes has misled some writers into maintaining that the value of gold and silver is imaginary.39 The fact that money can, in certain functions, be replaced by mere symbols of itself, gave rise to ano\nmod000058.xml|130| equivalent form of a commodity does not imply that the magnitude of its value can be determined. Therefore, even if we know that gold is money, and consequently directly exchangeable with all other commodities, this still does not tell us how much 1Olb. of gold i\nmod000058.xml|130|t gold is money, and consequently directly exchangeable with all other commodities, this still does not tell us how much 1Olb. of gold is worth, for instance. Money, like every other commodity, cannot express the magnitude of its value except relatively in other c\nmod000058.xml|130|-configuration ready to hand, in the form of a physical commodity existing outside but also alongside them. This physical object, gold or silver in its crude state, becomes, immediately on its emergence from the bowels of the earth, the direct incarnation of all h\nmod000058.xml|130|the sale, the linen plays these two parts in its own person. But then it goes the way of all flesh, enters the chrysalis state as gold, and thereby simultaneously completes the first metamorphosis of a third commodity. Hence the circuit made by one commodity in th\nmod000058.xml|130|s to the value of 2 shillings. If then, twenty-four hours of labour, or two working days, are required to produce the quantity of gold represented by 12 shillings, it follows first of all that two days of labour are objectified in the yarn.> We should not let ours\nmod000058.xml|130|ce, during the spinning process, the cotton absorbs 6 hours of labour.

This two and a half days of labour is represented by a piece of gold of the value of 15 shillings.

They t\nmod000147.xml|130| sent to Delphi many others of less account, among the rest a number of round silver basins.

Towards evening the coolness increases, till about sunset it becomes very cold. When the Indians reach the place where the gold is, they fill their bags with the sand, and ride away at their best speed: the ants, however, scenting them, as the Persians say,\nmod000147.xml|130|othing in the world like them: if it were not, therefore, that the Indians get a start while the ants are mustering, not a single gold-gatherer could escape. During the flight the male camels, which are not so fleet as the females, grow tired, and begin to drag, f\nmod000147.xml|130|nd, and never give way or flag. Such, according to the Persians, is the manner in which the Indians get the greater part of their gold; some is dug out of the earth, but of this the supply is more scanty.> It seems as if the extreme regions of the earth were bless\nmod000147.xml|130|ere the south declines towards the setting sun lies the country called Ethiopia, the last inhabited land in that direction.

In this desert, then, and in the sand, there are ants, in size somewhat l\nmod000149.xml|130| as the ants in Greece do, and in the same manner; and they are very like them in shape. The sand that is heaped up is mixed with gold. The Indians, therefore, go to the desert to get this sand, each man having three camels, on either side a male one harnessed to \nmod000149.xml|130|between the hinder legs to the tail. 104. The Indians then, adopting such a plan and such a method of harnessing, set out for the gold, having before calculated the time, so as to be engaged in their plunder during the hottest part of the day; for during the heat \nmod000149.xml|130| of the young they have left, do not slacken their pace. Thus the Indians, as the Persians say, obtain the greatest part of their gold; and they have some small quantity more that is dug in the country. 106. The extreme parts of the inhabited world somehow possess\nmod000149.xml|130|horses; in this respect they are surpassed by the Medic breed called the Nysaean horses.

And certain wild trees th\nmod000149.xml|130|eclines8 toward the setting sun, the Ethiopian territory reaches, being the extreme part of the habitable world.

But Maeandrius, having come \nmod000149.xml|130|, said to the women that this was the man who had saved the king's life; whereupon each of them, dipping a goblet into a chest of gold, presented Democedes with such a munificent gift, that a servant whose name was Sciton, following behind, picked up the staters t\nmod000149.xml|130|vant whose name was Sciton, following behind, picked up the staters that fell from the goblets, and collected a large quantity of gold. 131.

To those Few, if properly trained, the privilege and right to exercise \nmod000244.xml|130|inions, prescribed by authority: including among those opinions deliberate ethical and political fictions, such as that about the gold and silver earthborn men.

This he brake in pieces and made therefrom the image \nmod000267.xml|130|m her who she was. And Amasis also dedicated offerings in Greece. Firstly, in Cyrene he dedicated an image of Athena covered with gold, and a likeness of himself executed in painting; and moreover he dedicated to Athena in Lindus two stone images and a marvellous \nmod000267.xml|130|nd comely daughter, who alone remained of all his house; and her name was Nitetis.

Camillus attacked the Gauls while they were off their guard, their minds pre-occupied with obtaining the gold and securing peace; he, on the other hand, had driven them off when they were armed for battle and actually capturing the Citadel\nmod000272.xml|130|s abuse of the senate. Indifferent to the truth or falsehood of what he said, he declared, among other things, that the stores of gold collected for the Gauls were being hidden away by the patricians; they were no longer content with appropriating the public lands\nmod000272.xml|130|debts of the plebs could be wiped off. With this hope held out to them they thought it a most shameful proceeding that whilst the gold got together to ransom the City from the Gauls had been raised by general taxation, this very gold when recovered from the enemy \nmod000272.xml|130|ful proceeding that whilst the gold got together to ransom the City from the Gauls had been raised by general taxation, this very gold when recovered from the enemy had become the plunder of a few.

Then I did what I could to save the body of citizens as a whole, now I am doing what I can to help individuals. As to the gold of the Gauls, your question throws difficulties round a thing which is simple enough in itself. For why do you ask me about a mat\nmod000272.xml|130| prosecution at the actual trial, beyond the gatherings at his house, his seditious utterances, and his false statement about the gold, I do not find stated by any authority. But I have no doubt that it was anything but slight, for the hesitation shown by the peop\nmod000272.xml|130|e was over. No one since Camillus celebrated a more justly deserved triumph over the Gauls than C. Sulpicius. A large quantity of gold taken out of the spoil was dedicated by him and stored away in a vault beneath the Capitol. The campaigns in which the consuls fo\nmod000272.xml|130|e said, \"heard my father, consuls, say that he was the only one in the Capitol who refused to ransom the City from the Gauls with gold, for the force in the Capitol was not invested and shut in with fosse and rampart, as the Gauls were too indolent to undertake th\nmod000272.xml|130|ch the gods themselves cannot evade!

The latter proved the safer refuge, for the camp, situated in the plain below, was taken the same day. The gold and silver were ordered to be brought to the consul; the rest of the spoil became the property of the soldiers. The killed and pr\nmod000272.xml|130| glittering armour made in which their troops were quite resplendent. There were two divisions; one had their shields plated with gold, the other with silver. The shield was made straight and broad at the top to cover the chest and shoulders, then became narrower \nmod000272.xml|130|eave, and their helmets were plumed to give them the appearance of being taller than they really were. The tunics of the men with gold plated shields were in variegated colours, those with the silver shields had tunics of white linen.

They looked upon those things as a spoil for the enemy rather than a def\nmod000272.xml|130|ace amongst all the tribes. Such deep indignation was aroused by the election of Flavius that most of the nobles laid aside their gold rings and military decorations as a sign of mourning. From that time the citizens were divided into two parties; the uncorrupted \nmod000272.xml|130|specially against the Romans, a nation whom they justly boast of having captured and then allowing them to ransom themselves with gold. If the Etruscans had the same spirit which Porsena and their ancestors once had there was no reason why they should not expel th\nmod000272.xml|130|avelin, and an army resplendent in dazzling white would be stained with gore when the sword came into play. A Samnite army all in gold and silver had once been annihilated by his father, and those trappings had brought more glory as spoils to the victors than they\nmod000272.xml|130|dvocated peace on such terms would be put to death. The conditions were that restitution should be made to the Turdetani, all the gold and silver should be delivered up, and the inhabitants should depart with one garment each and take up their abode wherever the C\nmod000272.xml|130|es from you; your fields and lands he leaves you; and he will assign you a site where you can build a new town.

After thus traversing Spain and the tribes of Gaul the envoys returne\nmod000272.xml|130|it would be betrayed to them. Dasius, a Brundisian, was commandant of the garrison, and he was induced by a moderate bribe of 400 gold pieces to betray Clastidium to Hannibal. The place was the granary of the Carthaginians while they were at the Trebia. No cruelty\nmod000272.xml|130|purified, and full-grown victims were sacrificed to the deities named in the Sacred Books; an offering of forty pounds' weight of gold was conveyed to Juno at Lanuvium, and the matrons dedicated a bronze statue of that goddess on the Aventine. At Caere, where the \nmod000272.xml|130|tronghold of Italy, the City of Rome and its empire, we Neapolitans have thought it but right to assist the Roman people with the gold which has been left by our ancestors for the enriching of our temples and for a reserve in time of need.

Besides, we had heard that our ancestors had ransomed themselves from the Gauls with gold, and that your fathers, sternly as they set themselves against all conditions of peace, did nevertheless send delegates to Tarent\nmod000272.xml|130|ght to be offered to the immortal gods. [23.12]As evidence that the joyful tidings he brought were true, he ordered a quantity of gold rings to be piled up in the vestibule of the Senate-house, and they formed such a great heap that, according to some authorities,\nmod000272.xml|130|ay there was a general desire to begin the assault. The enthusiasm of the men had been kindled by the offer of a \"mural crown\" of gold and also by the way in which the general himself remonstrated with the men who had taken Saguntum for their slackness in attackin\nmod000272.xml|130|his hearing, he now consented to proposals for the ransom of all the freeborn citizens. The price agreed upon was seven ounces of gold for each person.

I cannot conceive how they can be less valuable than a similar weight of the gold of which they are made.> Mrs B.: The coined and the uncoined gold, it is true, remained in reality of the same value, but as it i\nmod000367.xml|130|ceive how they can be less valuable than a similar weight of the gold of which they are made. Mrs B.: The coined and the uncoined gold, it is true, remained in reality of the same value, but as it is not lawful to pass a guinea for more than a poundnote and a shil\nmod000367.xml|130|were compelled to share the fate of the paper-currency; and if that was depreciated, all the coined money of the country, whether gold or silver, must have been so likewise.> Caroline: Then, if it had not been illegal, every one would have melted his depreciated g\nmod000367.xml|130|ine: Then, if it had not been illegal, every one would have melted his depreciated guineas and shillings, and converted them into gold and silver bullion?> Mrs B.: Certainly. It is this which caused our specie to disappear, and transported it to foreign countries,\nmod000367.xml|130|cause it was dear; and sent our money to purchase goods at foreign markets, because they were cheap. Caroline: But if an ounce of gold rises in price from 3l. 17s. 10\u00bdd. to 5l., is it not rather the value of the bullion that has risen than the currency that has fa\nmod000367.xml|130|s for these bills raises their price, for they find it answer to give something more than the amount of the bill rather than send gold to Russia to pay for their hemp and tallow. The sum thus given for a bill above its amount is called a premium, and our exchange \nmod000367.xml|130| as the exports or imports prevail. But our exchange with Russia, I suppose, can never fall below what it would cost to transport gold to Russia; for as it is obtional with our merchants to pay either in bills or money, if the premium on the bill were greater than\nmod000367.xml|130|an the expense of sending money, they would prefer the latter mode of payment. Mrs B.: Undoubtedly; and as the expense of sending gold to different countries varies according to the distance, and to the facility or difficulty of our intercourse with them, a favour\nmod000367.xml|130|e: But the premium given for bills of exchange,  after all, does not supersede the necessity of our paying the balance of debt in gold; it merely removes the difficulty from one individual to another: for those merchants who finally cannot obtain bills must transm\nmod000367.xml|130|ods only to a trifling amount. The exchange would, in this case, be so unfavourable as to reduce us to the necessity of exporting gold in payment for the excess of imports, did not the bill-merchants come to our assistance. This useful class of men buy up the surp\nmod000367.xml|130|ept with such countries as, having mines of their own, may be said to produce money. If Spain and Portugal were to retain all the gold and silver which they derive from their mines, it would fall so much in value in those countries, that no laws could prevent its \nmod000367.xml|130| Spanish or Portuguese merchant could export in payment for the goods imported; and, indeed, we find that they supply Europe with gold and silver, in the same manner as we supply it with the produce of our West-Indian colonies, coffee and sugar. We have, in a form\nmod000367.xml|130|emarkably unfavourable to our exportations, the balance of foreign debt was very much against us, and the expense of transmitting gold considerably increased; so far the exchange may be said to have been really unfavourable. It is probable that both these causes c\nmod000367.xml|130|more money we receive for our work, the richer we must be. Caroline: Not if we export the fruits of their labour and receive only gold in return: for the poor are maintained not by the act of labour, but by its produce; and if all that produce were exported, and n\nmod000367.xml|130| for the poor are maintained not by the act of labour, but by its produce; and if all that produce were exported, and nothing but gold received in exchange, we should be much in the situation of King Midas, who was starved because every thing he touched was conver\nmod000367.xml|130| in exchange, we should be much in the situation of King Midas, who was starved because every thing he touched was converted into gold.> But do not the bill-merchants prevent this importation of gold, by transferring the bills of exchange from one country to anoth\nmod000367.xml|130|who was starved because every thing he touched was converted into gold. But do not the bill-merchants prevent this importation of gold, by transferring the bills of exchange from one country to another? for if our balance of trade is favourable with one country, i\nmod000367.xml|130| debt, but as a commodity for which there is a demand. This demand will always take place in thriving countries, not only because gold and silver bullion are wanted by jewellers and silversmiths for the purposes of luxury: but also because, as the saleable produce\nmod000367.xml|130|ops in those countries: so much does war reverse the natural order of things. Instead of exporting our manufactures to bring back gold, we were obliged to drain our circulation to send money in order to support our troops, whilst our manufacturers were either star\nmod000367.xml|130|e either starving, or became members of that very army which caused their ruin. Caroline: But if Spain, from the abundance of her gold and silver, imports such large quantities of manufactured goods, is it not a check to her industry at home?> Mrs B.: It certainly\nmod000367.xml|130| check to her industry at home? Mrs B.: It certainly is; though not so much as you would imagine, because she does not obtain the gold and silver of America free of cost; she obtains it partly  in the form of a tax imposed by the mother-country, or rent for the ro\nmod000367.xml|130| manufactured in Spain or Portugal. A Spanish merchant having imported goods from England and sent them to America, receives back gold and silver in payment, which are transmitted to England, if wanted there, Spain and Portugal being the entrep\u00f4t, in consequence o\nmod000367.xml|130|smitted to England, if wanted there, Spain and Portugal being the entrep\u00f4t, in consequence of the strict regulations by which the gold and silver are compelled to be brought to the mother-country.> The want of industry in Spain, though it proceeds in a great measu\nmod000367.xml|130|ecious metals has produced. In Townsend\u2019s Travels in Spain, which abound with philosophical observations, it is stated, \u201cthat the gold and silver of America, instead of animating the country and promoting industry, instead of giving life and vigour to the whole co\nmod000368.xml|130|ilosophy which made her scorn wealth; then she was deemed to be like a crazy woman; the most indecent made herself respected with gold; commerce in women was a kind of industry in the first class (of society), which, henceforth, will have no more credit. If it sti\nmod000370.xml|130|raged her to despise riches: she was then reduced to being considered awkward. The most indecent woman became respectable through gold; the commerce of women was a sort of trade that was accepted in the highest circles which, from now on, will have no credit. If i\nmod000374.xml|130| receive a currency which can be contracted or expanded ad libitum, these paper issues must be at a considerable discount against gold and silver. The discount will be the greater the more such a state imports from abroad, and the less it has to export in return.>\nmod000374.xml|130|estions are to be answered: firstly, how is the counterfeiting of drafts to be prevented? and secondly, how the counterfeiting of gold and silver? I am the more inclined to reply to these questions, since I can thus illustrate how that which is deemed impossible i\nmod000376.xml|130|count for; and their \"elementary\" character is merely fictional. It probably is in fact as absurd to speak of pure carbon or pure gold, as of a pure monkey or a pure dog. There are no such things, except as they may be arrived at by arbitrary definition and the me\nmod000379.xml|130|world, except for the sake of money, itself not excluded.

Again, when Taos was on the point of setting out from Egypt, Chabrias advised him to make requisition of all uncoined gold and silver in the possession of the inhabitants; and when most of them complied, he bade the king make use of the bullion, and re\nmod000197.xml|130|les for this unprovoked aggression; and gave orders for a battue.

The fact of its being accomplished, proves that it is a good thing. B. But Bacon's axiom is true in the case of gold and silver. If we admit that at a certain moment there exists in the world a given quantity, it is perfectly clear that one purse\nmod000394.xml|130|sts in the world a given quantity, it is perfectly clear that one purse cannot be filled without another being emptied. F. And if gold is considered to be riches, the natural conclusion is, that displacements of fortune take place among men, but no general progres\nmod000394.xml|130|tate the transmission of these useful things from one to another, which may be done equally well with an ounce of rare metal like gold, with a pound of more abundant material as silver, or with a hundredweight of still more abundant metal, as copper. According to \nmod000394.xml|130|do not believe that, on the whole, they will add much to the enjoyments, to the real satisfactions of mankind. If the Californian gold merely replaces in the world that which has been lost and destroyed, it may have its use. If it increases the amount of cash, it \nmod000394.xml|130|world that which has been lost and destroyed, it may have its use. If it increases the amount of cash, it will depreciate it. The gold diggers will be richer than they would have been without it. But those in whose possession the gold is at the moment of its depre\nmod000394.xml|130|h, it will depreciate it. The gold diggers will be richer than they would have been without it. But those in whose possession the gold is at the moment of its depreciation, will obtain a smaller gratification for the same amount. I cannot look upon this as an incr\nmod000394.xml|130|but, in the two suppositions that you have made, the increase is real, and you must allow that I am right. F. To a certain point, gold and silver have a value. To obtain this, men consent to give useful things which have a value also. When, therefore, there are mi\nmod000394.xml|130|seful things which have a value also. When, therefore, there are mines in a country, if that country obtains from them sufficient gold to purchase a useful thing from abroad\u2014a locomotive, for instance\u2014it enriches itself with all the enjoyments which a locomotive c\nmod000394.xml|130| home. The question is, whether it spends more efforts in the former proceeding than in the latter? For if it did not export this gold, it would depreciate, and something worse would happen than what you see in California, for there, at least, the precious metals \nmod000394.xml|130|cious metals are used to buy useful things made elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is still a danger that they may starve on heaps of gold. What would it be if the law prohibited exportation? As to the second supposition\u2014that of the gold which we obtain by trade; it i\nmod000394.xml|130|at they may starve on heaps of gold. What would it be if the law prohibited exportation? As to the second supposition\u2014that of the gold which we obtain by trade; it is an advantage, or the reverse, according as the country stands more or less in need of it, compare\nmod000394.xml|130|is not for the law to judge of this, but for those who are concerned in it; for if the law should start upon this principle, that gold is preferable to useful things, whatever may be their value, and if it should act effectually in this sense, it would tend to mak\nmod000394.xml|130|here would be a great deal of cash to spend, and nothing to buy. It is the very same system which is represented by Midas. B. The gold which is imported implies that a useful thing is exported, and in this respect there is a satisfaction withdrawn from the country\nmod000394.xml|130|d in this respect there is a satisfaction withdrawn from the country. But is there not a corresponding benefit? And will not this gold be the source of a number of new satisfactions, by circulating from hand to hand, and inciting to labour and industry, until at l\nmod000394.xml|130|pictures. You should begin, then, by proving that all these things create themselves; you must suppose the Mint melting ingots of gold which have fallen from the moon; or that the Board of Assignats be put in action at the national printing office; for you cannot \nmod000394.xml|130|red for each exchange, just as the players required more counters for each deposit.

B. No, but it is easy to substitute something else. I agree with you that gold and silver can do but little service, except as a mere means of exchange. It is the same with paper money, bank-notes, and c. The\nmod000394.xml|130|uits by a very mild deception. Why, then, refuse the philosopher's stone, which would teach us the secret of changing flints into gold, and, in the mean time, into paper money?

A measure of length, size, surface, is a quantity agreed upon, and unchangeable. It is not so with the value of gold and silver. This varies as much as that of corn, wine, cloth, or labour, and from the same causes, for it has the same source and\nmod000394.xml|130|buted by language to the other productions for which it is exchanged.
